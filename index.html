               <p id="para">
                    ☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931, in
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br>

                    ☛ He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.<br>

                    ☛ Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
                    1958
                    joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). <br>

                    ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the
                    SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. <br>

                    ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles,
                    which
                    helped earn him the nickname <strong>“Missile Man.”</strong> <br>

                    ☛ Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
                    incorporated
                    aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989. <br>

                    ☛ He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                    nuclear
                    tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974. <br>

                    ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as
                    principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. <br>

                    ☛ His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power
                    and
                    established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international
                    community. <br>

                    ☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as
                    a
                    road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan
                    called
                    for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle
                    for
                    economic growth, and widening access to health care and education. <br>

                    ☛ Kalam received <b>7</b> honorary doctorates from <b>40</b> universities. The Government of India
                    honoured him with
                    the <strong>Padma Bhushan in 1981</strong> and <strong>The Padma Vibhushan in 1990</strong> for his
                    work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as
                    a scientific advisor to the Government. <br>

                    ☛ In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
                    the
                    scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India. <br>

                    ☛ In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize
                    excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project". <br>

                    ☛ While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
                    died
                    from an apparent cardiac arrest on <strong>27 July 2015</strong> , aged 83. <br>

                    ☛ Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed <b>Kalam Island</b>in
                    September 2015.
                    <br>

                    ☛ A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b> in
                    August
                    2015. <br>

                    ☛ In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant species
                    as
                    Drypetes kalamii, in his honour. <br>
